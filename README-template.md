## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I took this opportunity to review the use of custom properties and try out nested selectors in CSS. I plan to include these features in my workflow in all future projects.

### Continued development

I would like to work more on layout management (margins, paddings, etc.), and place the various elements correctly even without the help of Flexbox and Grid.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) - I found this CSS reset very useful, I don't know if it can be safely implemented in all future projects (if so let me know when you leave feedback).
